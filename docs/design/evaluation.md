# Evaluation: Flight and blind tasting

- A public **tasting room** repository with seeded issues per recipe and **hidden acceptance tests** brewers never see; planted bugs for Infection check; pull requests with planted defects for Guest tasting.
- **Real batches become samples:** any batch that got stuck or needed human fixes can be exported into the Flight.
- **Metrics per recipe × brewer × model:** hidden-test pass rate, first-attempt gravity pass rate, retries, stuck rate, tokens, duration, diff size, planted-defect recall.
- **Blind tasting:** `foedrum taste --model <id> [--brewer <name>]` swaps one brewer's model, runs the Flight several times (agent runs are noisy) and compares with the baseline.
- **Model watcher:** when Anthropic lists a new model, Foedrum runs blind tasting per brewer and opens a pull request on the Brewery that updates `models.jsonc`, with the report as its description.
- The same harness gates changes to Foedrum's own default brewers and recipes.
